## Overview

The `esl_demo` program serves as the main executable and entry point for the Electronic Structure Library (ESL) application. It orchestrates the entire calculation flow, from initial setup and input parsing to the core self-consistent field (SCF) computation and final resource cleanup. The program is designed to perform a computational task, such as a single point energy calculation or one step in a geometry optimization or molecular dynamics run. It integrates various modules of the ESL to achieve this, including system setup, basis set management, SCF iterations, and optionally, scripting via Lua and parallel processing via MPI.

## Key Components

- **Program:** `esl_demo`
    - **Description:** The top-level Fortran program. It calls initialization routines (`esl_init`), the primary computational logic (`esl_main`), and finalization routines (`esl_end`).
    - **Variables:**
        - `input_file (character(len=256))`: Stores the name of the main input configuration file.
        - `out_unit (integer)`: Fortran unit number for the primary output file.

### Subroutine/Function: `esl_main()`

- **Description:** This subroutine contains the central logic for executing a computational step. It involves:
    1.  Initializing the `system_t` object, which encapsulates overall system properties like geometry and basis set.
    2.  Conditionally invoking Lua hooks if `WITH_FLOOK` is enabled (`LUA_INITIALIZE`).
    3.  Initializing the `states_t` object, which manages electronic states (wavefunctions, occupation numbers). The initialization path currently differs slightly based on whether a Plane-Wave or Atomic-Centered basis is used.
    4.  A loop (currently set for `nstep = 1`) that represents major computational steps (e.g., MD steps, though only one is performed in the current setup).
    5.  Inside the loop:
        *   `next_step_setup(system)`: Prepares the system for the upcoming calculation.
        *   `scf%init(system, states)`: Initializes the `scf_t` object, preparing for the SCF cycle.
        *   `smear%init()`: Initializes the `smear_t` object for Fermi-Dirac smearing.
        *   `elsic%init(...)`: Initializes the `elsi_t` object, which acts as a connector to the ELSI library for eigensolvers.
        *   `scf%loop(elsic, system, states, smear)`: Executes the main SCF iterative loop to solve for the electronic ground state.
        *   Conditional Lua hooks for `LUA_FORCES` and `LUA_NEXT_STEP`.
- **Key Modules Used:** `esl_system_m`, `esl_scf_m`, `esl_states_m`, `esl_smear_m`, `esl_elsi_m`, `esl_next_step_m`, `esl_basis_m`.

### Subroutine/Function: `esl_init()`

- **Description:** Performs global initialization tasks at the very beginning of the program's execution. These tasks include:
    1.  Initializing the MPI environment if `WITH_MPI` is enabled.
    2.  Determining the input file name: defaults to "sample.inp" but can be overridden by a command-line argument.
    3.  Initializing `f_lib` (likely a Fortran YAML or general utility library).
    4.  Printing program information using `about()`.
    5.  Setting up the FDF (Flexible Data Format) system:
        *   Defines an echo file name (e.g., "input.inp.echo").
        *   Calls `fdf_init` to parse the main input file and write to the echo file.
    6.  Reading the desired main output file name from the FDF input (default 'sample.out') and opening this file for writing, storing its unit number in `out_unit`.
    7.  Initializing the pseudo-random number generator via `init_random()`.
    8.  Initializing the Lua scripting interface via `flook_if_init(LUA)` if `WITH_FLOOK` is enabled.
- **Key Modules Used:** `fdf`, `esl_numeric_m`, `esl_info_m`, `prec`, `yaml_output`, `mpi` (optional), `esl_flook_if_m` (optional).

### Subroutine/Function: `esl_end()`

- **Description:** Performs global finalization and cleanup tasks before the program terminates. This includes:
    1.  Finalizing the `f_lib` library.
    2.  Shutting down the FDF system using `fdf_shutdown()`.
    3.  Closing the main output file associated with `out_unit`.
    4.  Finalizing the MPI environment using `MPI_Finalize` if `WITH_MPI` is enabled.
- **Key Modules Used:** `fdf`, `mpi` (optional).

## Important Variables/Constants

- `input_file (character(len=256))`: (Local to `esl_demo` program scope, primarily used in `esl_init`) Name of the input configuration file.
- `out_unit (integer)`: (Local to `esl_demo` program scope) Fortran unit number for the main output textual log file.
- `LUA` (Module variable from `esl_flook_global_m`, if `WITH_FLOOK` is defined): Represents the Lua interpreter instance/state.

## Usage Examples

```fortran
! This is the main program, executed from the command line.
! To run: ./esl_demo [your_input_file.inp]
! If no argument is provided, it defaults to "sample.inp".
! The program reads parameters from the input file, performs an SCF calculation,
! and writes results to the specified output file.
```

- **Interactions with other components:**
    - `esl_demo` is the highest-level component, initiating and coordinating all other modules.
    - `esl_init` reads configuration using `fdf` and sets up the global environment.
    - `esl_main` drives the primary computation:
        - It initializes `system_t` and `states_t`.
        - It then initializes `scf_t` and calls its `loop` method. The `scf%loop` is the heart of the calculation, iteratively:
            - Calculating density (via `esl_density_m`).
            - Calculating potential (via `esl_potential_m`).
            - Building and diagonalizing the Hamiltonian (via `esl_hamiltonian_m`, which in turn uses `esl_hamiltonian_pw_m` or `esl_hamiltonian_ac_m`, and solvers like ELSI via `esl_elsi_m`).
            - Checking for convergence.
    - `esl_end` performs cleanup.
    - Lua hooks, if enabled, allow external scripts to query or modify program state at specific checkpoints.
