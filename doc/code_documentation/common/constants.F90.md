## Overview

The `esl_constants_m` module provides a centralized repository for fundamental mathematical constants that are utilized across various parts of the electronic structure application. Its primary purpose is to ensure consistency and maintainability by defining these commonly used values in a single, accessible location. Currently, it defines the mathematical constant Pi (`PI`) and a conversion factor for converting angles from degrees to radians (`DEG`).

## Key Components

- **Module:** `esl_constants_m`
    - **Description:** A module dedicated to defining global mathematical constants. It imports the double precision kind `dp` from the `prec` module and then makes `dp` private to its own scope, ensuring that only the constants themselves are publicly exported.
    - **Public Entities:** `PI`, `DEG`.

## Important Variables/Constants

- **`PI (real(dp), parameter)`**
    - **Description:** Represents the mathematical constant Pi (π), which is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.
    - **Value:** `3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510_dp` (defined to a high degree of precision).
- **`DEG (real(dp), parameter)`**
    - **Description:** A conversion factor used to convert angles from degrees to radians. It is mathematically defined as π/180.
    - **Value:** Calculated as `PI / 180.0_dp`.

## Usage Examples

```fortran
! TODO: Add usage example
! Example of how other modules might use these constants:

module geometry_operations_m
  use esl_constants_m, only: PI, DEG
  use prec, only: dp ! Assuming dp is needed for other variables
  implicit none

  public :: calculate_circumference

contains

  function calculate_circumference(radius) result(circumference)
    real(dp), intent(in) :: radius
    real(dp) :: circumference
    circumference = 2.0_dp * PI * radius
  end function calculate_circumference

  function convert_angle_to_radians(angle_degrees) result(angle_radians)
    real(dp), intent(in) :: angle_degrees
    real(dp) :: angle_radians
    angle_radians = angle_degrees * DEG
  end function convert_angle_to_radians

end module geometry_operations_m
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **Internal Dependencies:**
    - `prec, only: dp`: The module imports the `dp` kind specifier (likely for double precision) from the `prec` module. This is used to define the floating-point precision of the constants `PI` and `DEG`. The `dp` symbol itself is then made private to the scope of `esl_constants_m`, meaning that modules using `esl_constants_m` do not automatically gain access to `dp` through it, promoting cleaner namespace management.
- **External Libraries:**
    - This module has no dependencies on external libraries.
- **Interactions with other components:**
    - The `esl_constants_m` module is intended to be widely used by any other module or subroutine within the application that requires access to these fundamental mathematical constants. For instance:
        - Geometry-related calculations might use `PI` for operations involving circles or spheres, or `DEG` for angle conversions.
        - Modules dealing with wave phenomena, reciprocal space, or Fourier transforms would frequently use `PI`.
        - Implementations of specific mathematical functions or algorithms might also require these constants.
    - By providing these constants in a central place, the application avoids the use of "magic numbers" and ensures that all parts of the code use the same, accurately defined values.
