## Overview

The `esl_info_m` module provides a utility subroutine, `about`, whose purpose is to gather and display information about the environment in which the application was compiled and is running. This includes details about the Fortran compiler (its version and the options used during compilation) and, if the application was compiled with MPI (Message Passing Interface) support (indicated by the `WITH_MPI` preprocessor flag), information about the MPI standard and the specific MPI library implementation being used. The output generated by the `about` subroutine is formatted using YAML for clarity and ease of parsing.

## Key Components

- **Module:** `esl_info_m`
    - **Description:** A utility module that offers a subroutine (`about`) to print details regarding the compiler and, if applicable, the MPI environment.
- **Public Subroutine:**
    - `about()`: This is the primary and only public procedure in this module. When called, it collects and prints various pieces of environment information.

### Subroutine/Function: `about()`
- **Description:** This subroutine performs the following actions:
    1.  Opens a YAML mapping titled "About".
    2.  Retrieves and prints the compiler version string using `compiler_version()` from `iso_fortran_env`.
    3.  Retrieves and prints the compiler options used during compilation using `compiler_options()` from `iso_fortran_env`.
    4.  If `WITH_MPI` is defined:
        *   Calls `MPI_Get_version` to get the MPI standard version (major and minor) and prints it.
        *   If `OLDMPI` is *not* defined (implying a more modern MPI version that supports `MPI_Get_library_version`), it calls this function to get a string describing the MPI library implementation and its version, and prints this information.
    5.  Closes the "About" YAML mapping.
- **Arguments:** None.
- **Returns:** Not applicable (Subroutine).

## Important Variables/Constants
- This module does not define any public Fortran `parameter` constants.

## Usage Examples
```fortran
! TODO: Add usage example
! Conceptual usage in a main program's initialization phase:

! program my_application
!   use esl_info_m, only: about
!   implicit none
!
!   call program_setup()
!
! contains
!   subroutine program_setup()
!     ! ... other initialization steps ...
!     call about() ! Print environment information
!     ! ... continue setup ...
!   end subroutine program_setup
!
! end program my_application
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **Internal Dependencies:**
    - `iso_fortran_env, only : compiler_options, compiler_version`: This intrinsic Fortran module is used to access information about the compiler (name, version, options).
    - `prec, only :ip`: Imports the integer precision kind `ip`. While not directly used in the local variable declarations of the `about` subroutine shown, its inclusion might be for general module consistency or for other private routines not detailed.
    - `yaml_output`: This module (presumably custom) is used to format the output information into a human-readable YAML structure (using `yaml_mapping_open`, `yaml_map`, `yaml_mapping_close`).
    - `mpi` (Conditional, if `WITH_MPI` is defined): If the application is compiled for parallel execution with MPI, this module provides the necessary MPI library routines like `MPI_Get_version` and (if not `OLDMPI`) `MPI_Get_library_version` to query details about the MPI environment.
- **External Libraries:**
    - **MPI (Message Passing Interface) library** (Conditional, if `WITH_MPI` is defined): The MPI library itself is an external dependency if the code is compiled with MPI support. The `about` routine interacts with this library to retrieve version information.
- **Interactions with other components:**
    - **Application Initialization (e.g., `esl_main_m` or a specific `esl_init` routine):** The `about()` subroutine is typically invoked once at the beginning of an application's execution. This is usually done within a global initialization phase to log the environment details as part of the program's startup output.
    - **Logging and Output:** The information printed by `about()` serves as valuable metadata for any given run of the application. This data can be crucial for:
        -   Debugging, by knowing the exact environment a problem occurred in.
        -   Reproducibility of results, as compiler versions and options can sometimes influence outcomes.
        -   Reporting and record-keeping for computational experiments.
    - **Build System:** The preprocessor flags `WITH_MPI` and `OLDMPI` (if used) are set by the build system and determine whether MPI-related information is queried and printed.
