## Overview

The `esl_basis_base_m` module defines a fundamental derived type, `basis_base_t`. This type serves as a foundational building block for various specific basis set implementations within the electronic structure code. It encapsulates common attributes that are likely shared across different types of basis sets, such as plane waves or atomic orbitals. The primary properties it holds are the size of the basis set and an associated auxiliary real-space grid.

## Key Components

- **Module:** `esl_basis_base_m`
    - **Description:** Provides the `basis_base_t` derived type, intended as a common base for different specific basis set implementations.
- **Type:** `basis_base_t`
    - **Description:** A base data type for basis sets, containing attributes common to various basis representations. Although its components are initially declared `private` in the type definition block, `size` and `grid` are subsequently made `public` members. The type itself is `public`.
    - **Components (public):**
        - `size (integer)`: An integer representing the size of the basis set. This could correspond to the number of plane waves, atomic orbitals, or other basis functions.
        - `grid (type(grid_t))`: An object of type `grid_t` (defined in `esl_grid_m`). This likely represents an auxiliary real-space grid that might be used for operations related to the basis set, such as Fourier transforms or integration of real-space quantities.

## Important Variables/Constants

- This module does not define any public Fortran `parameter` constants.

## Usage Examples

```fortran
! TODO: Add usage example
! Conceptual usage:
! This type is likely used as a component within other, more specific basis types.
!
! module my_specific_basis_m
!   use esl_basis_base_m
!   implicit none
!
!   type, public :: specific_basis_t
!     private
!     type(basis_base_t) :: base_properties
!     ! ... other specific properties ...
!   contains
!     procedure, public :: init
!     ! ... other procedures ...
!   end type specific_basis_t
!
! contains
!
!   subroutine init(this, required_size, associated_grid)
!     class(specific_basis_t), intent(out) :: this
!     integer, intent(in) :: required_size
!     type(grid_t), intent(in) :: associated_grid
!
!     this%base_properties%size = required_size
!     this%base_properties%grid = associated_grid
!     ! ... initialize other specific parts ...
!   end subroutine init
!
! end module my_specific_basis_m
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **Internal Dependencies:**
    - `esl_grid_m`: This module is used to provide the definition for `grid_t`, which is a component of `basis_base_t`. The `grid_t` likely defines the properties and operations related to a real-space grid.
- **External Libraries:**
    - No external library dependencies are apparent from the code in this module.
- **Interactions with other components:**
    - **Composition/Inheritance:** `basis_base_t` is designed to be a foundational element for more specialized basis set types within the ESL (Electronic Structure Library) framework. For example, modules like `esl_basis_pw_m` (for plane-wave basis) or `esl_basis_ac_m` (for atomic-centered orbital basis) would likely contain a `basis_base_t` object as a component (composition) or conceptually extend its features. These higher-level basis modules would manage the specific details of their representation while relying on `basis_base_t` for common properties like size and an auxiliary grid.
    - **Grid Operations:** The presence of `grid_t` suggests that operations involving this auxiliary grid (e.g., mapping data to/from this grid, performing calculations on it) are relevant for any basis set type that utilizes `basis_base_t`.
